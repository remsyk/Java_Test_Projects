*** For 3/28/2017 (HWK6)

a) Ask the user to enter a number to add to a jar. Validate the user's input   XXXXXXXXXXX
using a Regular Expression.

b) Ask the user to enter a label to give to a LabeledJar. The label can only   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
contain letters and numbers and no special characters such as "/", etc. Again,
validate the user's input using a Regular Expression.

c) Write a few jars to a file, exit the program, re-enter the program  
and retrieve the jars from the file.  Please keep the following steps in mind:

  1) Let the user select the file name.  If the file exists, be sure it is OK to
     overwrite the file.

  2) Before reading the jars from the file, use the "file chooser" object to 
     allow the user to specify the file name.

d) Overload the hashCode method of the class JarType to return an "appropriate" hash code.
(for hints, be sure to see the hand-out "The hashCode() Contract" on the website)

e) Try to create a Java Archive (jar) file for your "jar" project -- no need to hand it in.
   You should be able to run your MyProg from your jar file.
